My interests include:

- Technological progress
- Philosophies of history and politics
- Scale and the limits of growth
- Machine learning, supervised or otherwise

Generally speaking, I am an infrequent writer.
Most public writing is vain, misguided, or both.
I do not pretend mine is an exception.

I study math, computer science, and old books at Stanford.

I've previously worked at Google, Palantir, and a few startups.
I'm currently working on something good.
